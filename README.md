# compliance-audit-router

A tool to receive compliance alert webhooks from an external source (eg. Splunk), look up the responsible engineer's information (eg. from LDAP), and create a compliance report ticket (eg. Jira) assigned to the engineer for follow-up.

## Configuration

Configuration is managed in the `~/.config/compliance-audit-router/compliance-audit-router.yaml` file.

Alternatively, configuration options may be set using environment variables according to the [Viper environmental variable setup](https://github.com/spf13/viper#working-with-environment-variables), with the prefix `CAR_` (eg. `CAR_LISTENPORT=8080`).

An example `compliance-audit-router.yaml` file:

```yaml
---
verbose: false
listenport: 8080

ldapconfig:
  host: ldaps://ldap.example.org
  searchbase: dc=example,dc=org
  scope: sub
  attributes:
    - manager
    - alternateID

splunkconfig:

  allowinsecure: false

jiraconfig:
  host: https://jira.example.org:443
